<h1>My microbit project</h1>  
<p>I worked on coding microbit and its servo extesion. I used microbit to control the movements of the servo. I worked with Jason for some time to figure out how to connect servo to microbit. I then wrote a code that is for controlling servos as propellers to move an airship. It allows users to use microbit buttons to control the movement of 2 servos.</p>
<p1>Some things I needed to do are:</p1>
<ul>
  <li>learn the funtions of different codes</li>
  <li>test out how the codes will affect the servos</li>
  <li>figure out how to control movement of 2 servos with 1 microbit</li>
</ul>
